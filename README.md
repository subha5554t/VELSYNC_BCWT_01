# VELSYNC_Blockchain_Task-01

## Task Title
Create Your First Smart Contract (Hello Blockchain)

## Internship Track
Blockchain & Web3 Technologies Internship

## Task Description
This task involves creating a very simple smart contract using Solidity to understand the basics of blockchain development. The smart contract stores a message on the blockchain and allows users to read and update it.

## Objectives
- Understand basic Solidity syntax
- Learn how smart contracts work
- Compile and deploy a contract using Remix IDE
- Interact with deployed smart contracts

## Smart Contract Details
The smart contract:
- Stores a string message on the blockchain
- Initializes the message as **"Hello Blockchain"**
- Provides a function to update the message
- Provides a function to read the message

## Technologies & Tools Used
- Solidity
- Remix IDE
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (Remix VM)
- MetaMask (optional)

## How to Run the Project
1. Open https://remix.ethereum.org
2. Create a new file named `HelloBlockchain.sol`
3. Paste the contract code
4. Compile using Solidity version 0.8.x
5. Deploy using Remix VM
6. Interact with the deployed contract

## Screenshots
Screenshots of compilation, deployment, and output are included in the `screenshots` folder as required.

## Learning Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience with Solidity
- Learned how to deploy and interact with smart contracts
- Understood blockchain fundamentals and contract execution
